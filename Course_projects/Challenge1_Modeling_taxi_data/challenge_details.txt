For this challenge, you will take on the role of a New York City taxicab data analyst that would like to do some analysis on taxi trips. 
- You are going to build and implement four new dbt models that will generate the tables for analysts who intend to perform some work. 
- Open the models directory under chapter two and perform your work there. 
1) First, create a new model called over_nine_miles.sql which generates a table that contains all the columns of the source data with only the taxi trips with a distance of over nine miles. 
2) Second, create a new model called credit_card_count.sql that contains a breakdown of the fares paid by credit card. 
3) Third, create a new model called cross_borough.sql which generates a table that contains all of the columns of the source data with only the trips which start in one borough and end in a different borough. 
4) Fourth, create a new model called avg_num_dropoff_manhattan.sql which contains the average number of passengers on all trips with a drop-off borough that is in Manhattan. For each of these, 
make sure you add the necessary information to schema.yml. Ensure that dbt run works as expected, and that once the tables are generated, they look as expected.

### Our task is to simplify the construction team scripts using a CTE or common table expression. 
- The goal is to make the code easy and understandable. 

### To get started
- run dbt seed for (raw_jobs.csv,raw_excavators)
- Running dbt seed populates the raw_excavators table and the raw_jobs table with data, so you can test your code appropriately.
 All of your code changes should happen in maintenance_cte.sql.
- As you implement the CTE, think of ways to validate its behavior to ensure it performs as expected. 

### By using CTEs effectively, 
- we should be able to streamline the maintenance work identification process and make everything 
  more readable and easy to manage for the construction team.

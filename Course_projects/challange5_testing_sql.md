### Unit testing in DBT
-  is specifically focused on validating the accuracy and correctness of SQL queries and the underlying logic within DBT models. 
- It involves testing individual components of code or models in isolation to ensure that they produce the expected results.
-  This helps identify any errors or issues early in the development process, ensuring that the data transformations
 and calculations are accurate and reliable.



### To Do: 
 1. Include some of the built in dbt tests into the columns.
 2. Create a custom dbt test to that will fail if any of the cohorts have more than 100 distinct adids.
